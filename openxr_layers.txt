They're defined in the windows registry under:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\1\ApiLayers\Implicit

All of them are keys of type DWORD 32, and value=0
The keys:

C:\Program Files\OpenKneeboard\bin\OpenKneeboard-OpenXR.json
C:\Program Files\OpenXR-Toolkit\XR_APILAYER_MBUCCHIA_toolkit.json
C:\Program Files\Ultraleap\OpenXR\UltraleapHandTracking.json
C:\Program Files\Virtual Desktop Streamer\openxr-oculus-compatibility.json

The Ultraleap one breaks some games! If your VR controllers can't interact with the game, that's probably the one breaking it. Just remove that key (can be recreated later on).
